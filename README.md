# PawLocal

PawLocal is a community-maintained directory of dog-friendly places across South East Queensland, from the Gold Coast to the Sunshine Coast.

## Project status

**Stages 2, 3, and 3.1 are complete and reviewed. Stage 4 is in progress.** Full-stack CI/CD workflows and a provider-neutral deployment adapter contract are present in the current worktree. They define automatic development deployment after successful `main` CI and separate manual production promotion of the same development-verified backend image digest. The deployment adapter, environment-scoped AWS OIDC roles, GitHub environment variables, and host target are not configured; host/provider selection is pending owner response. DSQL compatibility and a secure runtime identity/credential path are unresolved. No AWS resources have been provisioned through this work and no full-stack deployment has occurred. The MVP budget is approved, but deployment remains gated on those prerequisites. Telemetry is disabled for the initial release; enablement is deferred to [Issue #59](https://github.com/alanlima/pawlocal/issues/59). Backup, HA, RPO/RTO, restore, recovery, and rollback are out of MVP scope and deferred to [Issue #44](https://github.com/alanlima/pawlocal/issues/44). CI validates frontend and backend changes, the combined local Compose stack, and Terraform configuration. Mock data is selected only when `VITE_USE_MOCK_BACKEND=true`; the combined Compose stack selects the HTTP adapter. Place access and facility details are not represented as verified facts. See [local development setup](frontend/README.md).

Issue #43 records the full-stack release policy: PR CI, automatic deployment of successful main releases to development, and a separate manually dispatched production promotion of a release already verified in development. The current worktree implements that workflow control flow behind an adapter interface, but it cannot deploy until a host/provider and adapter are selected and configured, GitHub environments and OIDC roles are established, and DSQL compatibility/runtime identity are validated. The existing static-site Terraform configuration is not the full-stack deployment target. See the [AWS deployment runbook](docs/deployment-aws-frontend.md), [hosting proposal](docs/stage4-hosting-options.md), and [decision log](docs/decisions.md).

## Planned stack

React, TypeScript, Vite and Tailwind CSS; Python, FastAPI and Pydantic; PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy 2 and Alembic; Docker Compose; and OpenTelemetry with Grafana, Prometheus, Loki and Tempo. Local Compose uses PostgreSQL. Stage 4 workflow code is provider-neutral; host/provider choice and runtime identity remain pending owner response. DSQL is a candidate that still requires compatibility and credential validation. Hosted telemetry is disabled for the initial release; backup, HA and recovery are deferred. The MVP budget is approved; no cloud resources have been provisioned and deployment has not occurred.

## Backend development

Stage 3 backend setup, migration, API, and test instructions are in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md). Protected API operations validate Cognito access tokens; no Cognito or other AWS resources are provisioned in this stage.

## Frontend service mode

The frontend uses `MockPlaceService` only when `VITE_USE_MOCK_BACKEND=true`. When the toggle is false or unset, it selects the typed `HttpPlaceService` and uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (default `/api/v1`). Vite's development server proxies that path to `VITE_API_PROXY_TARGET` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000`); set the target to `http://backend:8000` in Compose. Production deployments should route `/api/v1` to the backend through their same-origin reverse proxy. A failed or unavailable API remains an HTTP error and never silently switches to mock data. The checked-in `.env.example` opts into mock mode for the local demo.

HTTP-mode authentication is a host integration seam, not a PawLocal sign-in flow. The host can inject `window.pawLocalAuth` before the app loads with `getAccessToken()` returning the current Cognito access token (sync or async), and optional `signIn()`/`signOut()` callbacks. The frontend requests a fresh token for each API call, sends it only as a Bearer header, and does not persist it. Hosts own authentication UX and token refresh. Without the host provider, protected actions report that authentication is unavailable; mock demo-member mode never authenticates HTTP requests. See [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md#host-authentication-integration) for the interface contract.

## Development

For the combined local frontend, API, PostgreSQL and observability stack, first copy `.env.example` to `.env` (`Copy-Item .env.example .env` in PowerShell). The example contains a clearly local-only PostgreSQL password placeholder; keep `.env` out of version control and replace the placeholder for your local environment. Compose requires `PAWLOCAL_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and has no built-in credential fallback. Then run `docker compose up --build -d` from the repository root. Open PawLocal at <http://localhost:5173>, Grafana at <http://localhost:3000>, and the API health endpoint at <http://localhost:8000/health>. See [frontend README](frontend/README.md) and [backend README](backend/README.md) for ports, health checks, privacy, synthetic failures, shutdown, migrations and tests. All local Compose services bind to localhost; running the local stack requires no cloud resources.
